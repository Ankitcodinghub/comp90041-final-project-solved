1 Overview

In this project, you will develop an extension of the program SimpleCompetitions that you developed in Assignment 2. SimpleCompetitions helps companies (e.g., retailers) create competitions to boost their sales. For instance, during Easter Sale, a retailer can use your software to create a lucky draw game. In the game, a customer is given entries equivalent to the size of its purchase after their single-purchase final balance, after discounts, reach a specific amount, say $50. Once the competition time ends, the retailer draws winners and the winning customers will get points added to their membership account; customers can use these points for future purchases if they wish. Please read the competition policy and application walk-through sections for more information. This final project is designed in such a way that we can evaluate your knowledge on all important topics you have learnt in this subject: 1) class design and implementation, 2) control flow structures (e.g., if-then-else &amp; switch-case statements, loops), 3) basic I/O (e.g., Scanner class, formatted printing), 4) arrays, 5) inheritance &amp; polymorphism, 6) exception handling, and 7) file I/O.

2 Your Task

Go to https://classroom.github.com/a/TeDP8xfn and accept the project. For details on how to check out the repository, make sure to consult the Lab 3 Materials . Once you have cloned the repository, you will find 12 classes.

For this project, there is NO ASSUMPTION that all data (e.g., user inputs, file content) will be of correct data types. So error control for incorrectly entered data types ARE REQUIRED unless stated otherwise!.

3 Competition Policy

In this project, your program must support two competition types (i.e., LuckyNumbers competition (like the competition implemented in Assignment 2) and RandomPick competition). Following is the updated competition policy that covers both of them.

‚Ä¢ Only customers who have valid membership accounts can enter a competition. Your program should check for this condition, see the program walk-through section for more details.

‚Ä¢ There is no limit on the number of competitions that a customer can enter. However, for this project, there is only one active competition (whose result is not decided) at a specific point in time i.e. the system does not support concurrent competitions.

‚Ä¢ In a specific competition, one customer can have an unlimited number of entries based on their paid bills.

‚Ä¢ Customers get one entry for each $50 in a single bill. For example, if a total bill is $245, it is eligible for getting four entries.

‚Ä¢ In terms of entry creation, if a competition is of LuckyNumbers type, for each entry, the customer is asked to select 7 numbers in the range from 1 to 35. You can imagine that s/he is provided a card on which s/he can manually select numbers for some entries and/or ask the system to randomly generate entries. Completed cards must be returned to a staff member after purchases so that the information can be inputted into the system. ‚Ä¢ In case of the RandomPick competition type, customers do not need to provide any numbers. Entries are automatically generated and each entry only has basic information like the Entry ID.

‚Ä¢ Once the competition time ends, the organizer can draw winners. Note that if a customer has several winning entries, only the first one with the highest prize will be awarded. By saying first winning entry, we mean the entry that has smallest entry identifier (i.e., Entry ID).

‚Ä¢ To find winners, in a LuckyNumbers competition, the system automatically generates a lucky entry that contains 7 lucky numbers. If an entry shares at least two numbers in common with the lucky entry, the owner of that entry would get some prize. The detailed prizes are listed on Table 1.

Division Winning number required Prize

1 7 numbers 50000 points

2 6 numbers 5000 points

3 5 numbers 1000 points

4 4 numbers 500 points

5 3 numbers 100 points

6 2 numbers 50 points

Table 1: Prize table ‚Ä¢ In a RandomPick competition, the system automatically picks 3 winning entries from the entry list of the competition. The prizes for the first, second, and third winning entries are 50,000 points, 5,000 points, and 1,000 points, respectively.

4 Application Walk-through

Note that all the user options are case insensitive unless stated otherwise. The program outputs (e.g., menus and output messages) look the same in both the normal and testing mode. The two modes are different only in the ways entries are generated and/or winning entries are chosen.

1. Your program will start by displaying a welcome message and then ask if the user wants to load existing competitions from a file. When the user runs the program for the first time, s/he should say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù by typing down ‚ÄòN‚Äô or ‚Äòn‚Äô. Afterwards, s/he will need to choose one mode (normal or testing mode) to start the program. And then the program will ask for names of the files containing membership and bill information. Once the file names are given, your program should create an object of the DataProvider class and use it to retrieve data from those files. If there is something wrong (e.g., the file cannot be found/opened or the file data is not in the correct format), your program should print an error message and gracefully terminate.

‚Äî-WELCOME TO SIMPLE COMPETITIONS APP‚ÄîLoad competitions from file? (Y/N)?

N

Which mode would you like to run? (Type T for Testing, and N for Normal mode):

T

Member file: members.csv Bill file: bills.csv

If the user chooses to load existing competitions from a binary file, s/he needs to provide the file name. The program will try to load that file and if there is an exception, it should display an error message and gracefully terminate. If the competitions are successfully loaded, the user does not need to choose the running mode (Testing or Normal) because the mode should be the same as the existing competitions. The remaining logic is similar. That is, file names for membership and bill data are still required.

‚Äî-WELCOME TO SIMPLE COMPETITIONS APP‚ÄîLoad competitions from file? (Y/N)?

Y File name: demo.dat Member file: members.csv Bill file: bills.csv

Following are the content of the text files members.csv and bills.csv that will be uploaded to the LMS page of this project.

Each line in the file members.csv contains a member id, a member name, and an address.

111111,John,john@abc.com

222222,Marry,marry@abc.com

333333,Atish,atish@abc.com

666666,Mia,mia@abc.com

777777,Louis,luis@abc.com

888888,Jenny,jenny@abc.com

Each line in the file bills.csv contains a bill id, a member id of the customer who paid for the bill, a bill total amount, and a boolean value showing whether that bill has been used in a competition or not. Some bills (e.g., 100013, and 100014) do not have member id; these represent the situations in which the customers did not have valid membership accounts or they did not give the information on their purchases. Based on the competition policy, those bills are ineligible to enter the competition.

2. If everything works, the program will display the main menu. The main menu has five options for 1) creating a new competition, 2) adding new entries for the current active competition, 3) drawing to find winners, 4) viewing a summary report of all competitions, and 5) exiting the program. Note that the user should not be able to 1) create a new competition if there is already an active one, or 2) add new entries or draw winners if there is no active competition. Error messages should be displayed if users try to do so. Following are some sample error messages. See all error messages in the provided test cases.

5. Exit1

There is an active competition. SimpleCompetitions does not support concurrent competitions!

4. Now the user can choose the second option to add entries. The program should first ask for thebill ID (i.e. receipt number). Unlike the Assignment 2, in this project the member ID and the total amount of the bill can be retrieved from the given bill file, which is bills.csv in this example. The bill ID needs to follow a specific format ‚Äì it must be 6-digit number and the number can start with zero(es). For example, both 001234 and 123456 are valid identifiers but 123abc is not. Moreover, according to the competition policy, only customers who have valid membership accounts are eligible to enter a competition. Your program should also check if a bill has already been used for a competition.

Please select an option. Type 5 to exit.

1. Create a new competition

2. Add new entries

3. Draw winners

4. Get a summary report

5. Exit

2

Bill ID:

123abc

Invalid bill id! It must be a 6-digit number. Please try again. Bill ID:

100013

This bill has no member id. Please try again. Bill ID: 100000

This bill ($300.5) is eligible for 6 entries. How many manual entries did the customer fill up?:

5. Once the bill ID passes all the required checks, your program will generate entries for the bill.The total bill amount should be used to calculate how many entries the customer can get for this bill. The two competition types generate entries in different ways. In case of LuckyNumbers competition, your program should ask for the number of manual entries for this bill. In the above example, the customer is eligible to get six entries for their bill. Suppose that s/he manually filled up one entry, by selecting 7 numbers in the range from 1 to 35, and asked for others to be automatically generated. The program output should looks like the following. You will observe that manual entries should be added first and entries‚Äô indices start from 1 for each new competition. Moreover, all entry numbers should be sorted in an ascending order.

This bill ($300.5) is eligible for 6 entries. How many manual entries did the customer fill up?:

1

Please enter 7 different numbers (from the range 1 to 35) separated by whitespace.

1. 2 3 4

Invalid input! Fewer than 7 numbers are provided. Please try again!

Please enter 7 different numbers (from the range 1 to 35) separated by whitespace.

1 2 3 4 9 6 7 10

Invalid input! More than 7 numbers are provided. Please try again!

Please enter 7 different numbers (from the range 1 to 35) separated by whitespace.

1 2 3 4 9 9 5

Invalid input! All numbers must be different!

Please enter 7 different numbers (from the range 1 to 35) separated by whitespace.

1 2 3 4 9 5 45

Invalid input! All numbers must be in the range from 1 to 35!

Please enter 7 different numbers (from the range 1 to 35) separated by whitespace.

1 2 3 4 10 7 5

The following entries have been added:

Entry ID: 1 Numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 7 10

Entry ID: 2 Numbers: 3 4 17 18 24 29 30 [Auto]

Entry ID: 3 Numbers: 2 7 14 18 22 25 35 [Auto]

Entry ID: 4 Numbers: 1 5 6 8 31 32 35 [Auto]

Entry ID: 5 Numbers: 2 5 11 12 23 24 34 [Auto]

Entry ID: 6 Numbers: 1 2 13 24 25 31 34 [Auto]

Add more entries (Y/N)?

6. The auto entries can be generated in different ways. In this project we leverage the shuffle method of the Collections class . We provide the implementation for the createNumbers method in the AutoNumbersEntry class. The randomness is controlled by the seed argument. In the testing mode, you should use the competition identifier as seed for generating the lucky entry and the number of entries in the currently active competition to generate automated customers‚Äô entries.

private final int NUMBER_COUNT = 7; private final int MAX_NUMBER = 35;

public int[] createNumbers (int seed) {

ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; validList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); int[] tempNumbers = new int[NUMBER_COUNT]; for (int i = 1; i &lt;= MAX_NUMBER; i++) {

validList.add(i);

}

Collections.shuffle(validList, new Random(seed)); for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUMBER_COUNT; i++) {

tempNumbers[i] = validList.get(i);

} Arrays.sort(tempNumbers); return tempNumbers;

}

7. If the competition is of RandomPick type, your program will use a simpler algorithm to generate the entries. Specifically, it just generate basic entries (objects of the base Entry class) ‚Äì no numbers are required.

Bill ID:

100000

This bill ($300.5) is eligible for 6 entries.

The following entries have been automatically generated:

Entry ID: 1

Entry ID: 2

Entry ID: 3

Entry ID: 4

Entry ID: 5

Entry ID: 6

Add more entries (Y/N)?

8. The user can then add more entries into the current competition. Your program must check if the given bill ID has already been used. If so, an error message should be displayed.

Add more entries (Y/N)?

Y

Bill ID:

100000

This bill has already been used for a competition. Please try again. Bill ID: 100001

This bill ($340.8) is eligible for 6 entries. How many manual entries did the customer fill up?:

0

The following entries have been added:

Entry ID: 7 Numbers: 2 3 15 18 26 27 31 [Auto]

Entry ID: 8 Numbers: 4 6 14 16 17 18 20 [Auto]

Entry ID: 9 Numbers: 2 13 26 28 29 32 34 [Auto]

Entry ID: 10 Numbers: 1 6 11 13 14 18 24 [Auto]

Entry ID: 11 Numbers: 5 7 16 21 23 26 28 [Auto]

Entry ID: 12 Numbers: 2 10 13 21 23 24 27 [Auto]

Add more entries (Y/N)?

The user can choose ‚ÄòN‚Äô to go back to the main menu. At the main menu, s/he might want to choose the 2nd option to add more entries or choose the 3rd option to draw and find winners.

9. If the 3rd option from the main menu is selected and the current active competition is of LuckyNumbers type, the program will automatically generate a lucky entry using the same algorithm it used to generate automated user entries. Recall that in the testing mode, your program should use the competition identifier as seed for generating the lucky entry. The program then display the information of the lucky numbers and all the winning entries with their prizes. The entries are sorted by their identifiers. As stated in the competition policy, if a customer has several winning entries, only the first one with the highest prize will be awarded. By saying first winning entry, we mean the entry that has smallest entry identifier.

Otherwise, the user needs to provide the file name, say demo.dat. All competitions should be saved to the file in a binary format (using the writeObject method of the ObjectOutputStream class). The bill file (bills.csv in this example) should also be updated/overwritten as well to make the whole system consistent. The first three columns of the bill file (bill IDs, member IDs, and bill total) should not be modified.

5 Example Executions

In this section, we show two example executions in the testing mode with and without existing competitions in file. Note that the program logic for testing and normal mode is almost the same and the outputs look similar. The two modes are only different in the ways random numbers are generated. Specifically, for the testing mode, since the randomness is controlled by using seeds, if you provide the same input, the program should produce the same output. Note that in the example executions, we show both the input and output of the program. In the given test cases, the input and output are stored in different files. See Section 7 (Testing Before Submission) for more details.

5.1 Example execution without existing competitions. The user starts running the program from scratch.

6 Assessment &amp; Important Notes

Your Java program will be assessed based on correctness of the output as well as quality of code implementation.

Automatic tests will be conducted on your program by compiling, running, and comparing your outputs for several test cases with generated expected outputs. The automatic test will deem your output wrong if your output does not match the expected output, even if the difference is just having an extra space or missing a colon. Therefore, it is crucial that your output follows exactly the same format

shown in the examples above.

7 Testing Before Submission

Details of how the submission works can be found in Section 8.

To test your code by yourself:

1. Check your source code files, and make sure you have the test input data files ready (e.g.,‚Äúinput1.txt‚Äù).

2. Open a console, navigate to your project directory (where your .java classes reside), and compileyour program: javac *.java (this command will compile all your java files in the current folder).

3. Run command: java SimpleCompetitions &lt; input1.txt &gt; my-output1.txt (it runs the program using contents in ‚Äúinput1.txt‚Äù as input and write the output to my-output1.txt).

5. Compare your result with the provided output file output1.txt. Fix your code if they are different.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all given input and output pairs. When you are satisfied with your project,commit your changes to GitHub. Note that the test cases 6, 7, and 8 must be run in order. Moreover, you should run the test cases 1 to 6 with the original bill file (i.e., bills.csv)

to get the same expected outputs. The 6th test case is supposed to overwrite the bill file. Then the updated file will be read and modified by the last two test cases (i.e., test cases 7 and 8).

Please follow the instructions in Lab-3 documentation if you want to use IDEs like

Eclipse.

8 Submission

Your submission should have at least 12 Java source code files. If you successfully cloned the assignment repository, these files should already be in your working directory. You can add more classes if you want but please ensure that you do not include irrelevant files (e.g., unused classes or test files) in your submission. You should verify your submission locally as described above before submitting your code to GitHub.

9 Individual Work

Note well that this project is part of your final assessment, so copying, working together, sharing work (i.e. cheating) is not acceptable! Any form of material exchange, whether written, electronic or any other medium is considered cheating, as is copying from any online sources in case anyone shares it. Providing undue assistance is considered as serious as receiving it, and in the case of similarities that indicate exchange of more than basic ideas, formal disciplinary action will be taken for all involved parties without exceptions! We have a sophisticated tool that undertakes deep structural analysis of Java code to identify regions of similarity.
